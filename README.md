# Pong Game

## Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's turtle module. The game includes two paddles and a ball. The game is over when the ball misses a paddle and hits the boundary.

## How to Play
- The left paddle is controlled by the 'w' (up) and 's' (down) keys.
- The right paddle is controlled by the 'Up' (up) and 'Down' (down) keys.
- The game starts immediately when run and continues until the ball hits a boundary.

## Classes
- `paddle`: This class represents a paddle. It can move up and down.
- `ball`: This class represents the ball. It moves in the game and bounces off paddles and the top and bottom of the screen.
- `score`: This class represents the score. It updates whenever the ball hits a boundary.

## Installation

2. Navigate to the repository in your terminal.
3. Run `python day21.py` to start the game.
